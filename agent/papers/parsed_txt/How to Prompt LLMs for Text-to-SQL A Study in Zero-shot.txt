## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have demonstrated remarkable capability in the text-to-SQL task. Previous research has prompted LLMs with various demonstration-retrieval strategies and intermediate reasoning steps to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, those works often employ varied strategies when constructing the prompt text for text-to-SQL inputs, such as databases and demonstration examples. This leads to a lack of comparability in both the prompt constructions and their primary contributions. Furthermore, selecting an effective prompt construction has emerged as a persistent problem for future research. To address this limitation, we comprehensively investigate the impact of prompt constructions across various settings and provide insights into prompt constructions for future text-to-SQL studies.

## Introduction

Text-to-SQL models enable users to query databases using natural language questions (NLQs) without having to develop the underlying SQL query. Over the past few decades, neural models with supervised learning have achieved impressive performance on the text-to-SQL task, which are usually trained on a large training set and then evaluated on test examples (Wang et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021; Rubin and Berant, 2021; Scholak et al., 2021; Gan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023a).

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for in-context learning on many language understanding and generation tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a; Chowdhery et al., 2022), including on the text-to-SQL task (Rajkumar et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Instead of training a text-to-SQL model on a large training set, in-context learning allows LLMs to convert a test NLQ into a SQL query using a prompt text. This prompt text includes essential components such as the test database and question. These are accompanied by zero or a few demonstrations: NLQ-SQL pairs corresponding to either the test database (single-domain) or different databases (cross-domain). Figure 1 provides an example of a prompt text for a one-shot single-domain task.

Previous research has augmented the text-to-SQL capability of LLMs with demonstration-retrieval strategies (Poesia et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022), intermediate reasoning steps (Cheng et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023), and self-debugging ability (Chen et al., 2023; Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023). However, those studies often employ different prompt strategies that include various key components of text-to-SQL: database

schema and content, and demonstration examples. The difference in prompt constructions makes it difficult to directly compare two studies on their main contribution, and the outcomes of different studies may change based on future revelations in prompt engineering.

In this paper, we evaluate various strategies for prompt construction in three commonly employed text-to-SQL settings: zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain. We assess LLMs on text-to-SQL, considering various database prompt constructions in all three settings. Additionally, in the cross-domain scenario, we investigate the strategy for constructing demonstrations. Through our evaluation, we aim to gain insights into the effectiveness of these prompt construction strategies. Our findings can be summarized as follows:

- Table relationship and table content play a crucial role in effectively prompting LLMs. However, it is essential to carefully consider their representation in the prompt, as LLMs are sensitive to the specific presentation in the zero-shot and cross-domain settings.
- In-domain demonstration examples can mitigate LLMs' sensitivity to different representations of database knowledge but they cannot replace table content knowledge.
- The length of the prompt has a significant impact on the LLMs' performance in the cross-domain setting. We discovered a preferred prompt length that leads to improved performance.

## 2 In-context Learning for Text-to-SQL

In the text-to-SQL task, a database and a natural language question (NLQ) are provided as input for generating an output SQL query. Traditional supervised learning approaches train models on specific text-to-SQL datasets. However, in-context learning allows pretrained large language models (LLMs) to perform text-to-SQL by providing either zero or a few training examples (NLQ-SQL pairs) as demonstrations. This section introduces three widely used settings for in-context learning in text-to-SQL. Prompt examples in these settings can be found in Appendix A.1.

### Zero-shot Text-to-SQL

This setting evaluates the text-to-SQL capability of pretrained LLMs to directly infer the NLQ-SQL relationship from a table without any demonstration examples. The input includes a task instruction and a test question with its corresponding database. Zero-shot text-to-SQL is used to directly assess the text-to-SQL capability of LLMs (Rajkumar et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023).

### Single-domain Few-shot Text-to-SQL

This setting is designed for applications or domains where it is easy to construct examples, such as booking flights (Price, 1990; Dahl et al., 1994) and querying geographic information (Zelle and Mooney, 1996). It tests the ability of LLMs to adapt with a few in-domain demonstration examples, which are collected from the same database as the test question. The goal is to evaluate how well the LLMs can perform text-to-SQL with minimal in-domain training data (Rajkumar et al., 2022).

### Cross-domain Few-shot Text-to-SQL

This setting evaluates the generalization capability of models to new domains by learning from out-of-domain demonstrations. In this scenario, the demonstration NLQ-SQL pairs correspond to one or multiple demonstration databases that are different from the test database. Cross-domain few-shot text-to-SQL assesses how well LLMs can apply their learned knowledge from demonstrations to new databases (Poesia et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023).

## 3 Prompt Construction

A text-to-SQL prompt typically comprises four components: a task instruction, a test database, a test NLQ, and optional demonstrations, as illustrated in Figure 1. While the task instruction and test NLQ are easily presented in natural language, there are various strategies for representing the databases and incorporating demonstrations. In this section, we explore different prompt constructions for databases and demonstrations.

### 3.1 Database Prompt

A relational database consists of the database schema and database content. The database schema encompasses the schemas (headers) of tables and the relationship among tables, and database content refers to the data stored in the tables.

Database Schema Figure 2 illustrates various prompt constructions for the database schema that have been utilized in previous studies: (1) Table(Columns) (Liu et al., 2023) lists each table along with its columns inside parentheses to represent the table schemas; (2) Columns=[] (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023) represents each table along with

========== PAGE BREAK ==========

Figure 2: Examples of the different database schema constructions for a snippet of database Network_1 in Spider.

sql
Table(Columns) (Liu et al., 2023)
Highschooler(ID, name, grade);
Friend(student_id, friend_id);

Columns=[] (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023)
Table Highschooler, Columns = [ID, name, grade];
Table Friend, Columns = [student_id, friend_id];

+FK (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023)
Foreign_keys = [Friend.student_id = Highschooler.ID, Friend.friend_id = Highschooler.ID];

CreateTable (Rajkumar et al., 2022)
CREATE TABLE Highschooler (
    ID int primary key,
    name text,
    grade int
);
CREATE TABLE Friend (
    student_id int,
    friend_id int,
    primary key (student_id, friend_id),
    foreign key(student_id) references Highschooler(ID),
    foreign key(friend_id) references Highschooler(ID)
);
```

a list of its columns using an equation-like notation; (3) +ForeignKey (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023) further adds foreign keys to indicate the relationships between tables; (4) CreateTable (Rajkumar et al., 2022) employed the "Create Table" statement to display the table schemas and relationships.

To ensure consistency in the prompt text and accommodate the case-insensitivity of SQL keywords and the database schema, we unify the space and line break in the prompt text and convert all words to lowercase, except for the database content. This normalization process helps to standardize the prompt text. An example is shown in Figure 4.

Database content Previous research shows that being aware of database content can improve model performance by exposing models to the specific format of values in each column (Wang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Scholak et al., 2021; Rajkumar et al., 2022). For instance, the phrase "American student" could be converted to "WHERE country = 'USA'" or "WHERE country = 'The United States of America'" depending on the contents of the country column.

Figure 3 summarizes different approaches used to construct prompts for showcasing the content of a database. (1) InsertRow (Chen et al., 2023):

Figure 3: Examples of the different database content constructions for showing 3 cell values in each column for the Highschool table in Figure 2.

```sql
InsertRow (Chen et al., 2023)
INSERT INTO Highschooler (ID, name, grade)
VALUES (1510, "Jordan", 9);
INSERT INTO Highschooler (ID, name, grade)
VALUES (1689, "Gabriel", 9);
INSERT INTO Highschooler (ID, name, grade)
VALUES (1381, "Tiffany", 9);

SelectRow (Rajkumar et al., 2022)
/*
3 example rows:
SELECT * FROM Highschooler LIMIT 3;
ID      name        grade
1510    Jordan      9
1689    Gabriel     9
1381    Tiffany     9
*/

SelectCol (Ours)
/*
Columns in Highschooler and 3 distinct
examples in each column:
ID: 1025, 1101, 1247
name: "Jordan", "Gabriel", "Tiffany"
grade: 9, 10, 11
*/
```

This method displays R rows of each table by utilizing R "INSERT INTO" statements. (2) SelectRow (Rajkumar et al., 2022): This approach employs the "SELECT * FROM Table LIMIT R" query to display the first R rows of each table. (3) SelectCol: Instead of presenting table content in a row-wise manner, an alternative method is to use a column-wise format. As there may be duplicated content across different rows, presenting the content column-wise ensures the provision of distinct values within each column to expose LLMs to a broader range of content. We propose using the query "SELECT DISTINCT [Column] FROM [Table] LIMIT R" to list R distinct cell values in each column.

### 3.2 Demonstration Prompt

In few-shot settings, LLMs are provided with demonstrations within the prompt text. In the single-domain few-shot setting, we incorporate a few pairs of NLQs and SQLs as demonstrations inserted between the test database and question, following previous work (Rajkumar et al., 2022). In the cross-domain few-shot setting, we use both out-of-domain NLQ-SQL pairs (demonstration examples) and corresponding databases (demonstration databases) placed before the test database and question. Prior research in the N-shot setting either uses one demonstration database with N examples (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023) or employs N demonstration databases, each with a single NLQ-SQL

========== PAGE BREAK ==========

Models We used GPT-3 Codex (Chen et al., 2021a) and ChatGPT due to their demonstrated performance and prevalence in the field.²

Experiment Setup For the zero-shot setting, we construct each prompt text with a task instruction, a test database, and a test question. We include R = 3 table rows in the database prompt, which has been discovered as the optimal number in previous work (Rajkumar et al., 2022). For the few-shot settings, we incorporate N demonstration examples in addition to the zero-shot prompt text.

In the single-domain text-to-SQL scenario, we use a leave-one-out split, as some databases in Spider-dev contain a small number of examples. When evaluating one example, we regard all other examples from the same database as the training set and randomly retrieve N examples from them. Since Spider contains multiple NLQs corresponding to the same SQL query, we require that the training set does not contain examples with the same SQL template as the test example, again following previous work (Finegan-Dollak et al., 2018).

In the cross-domain scenario, we randomly select M demonstration databases, each with K NLQ-SQL pairs (M × K = N) from the Spider training set. Incorporating multiple demonstration databases in a prompt text significantly increases its length. Hence, we only use Codex for the cross-domain experiments, due to its higher token limit of 8K, surpassing the 4K limit of ChatGPT. In both single-domain and cross-domain settings, we compare different prompt construction methods using the same few-shot examples to make a fair comparison. We repeat our experiments three times and present the average results.

Figure 4: An example of the normalization for database and SQL prompts.

pair (Poesia et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). In contrast, we consider a more general scenario where the demonstrations comprise M databases, each with K NLQ-SQL pairs, with M × K = N. We list the examples of 4-shot single-domain and cross-domain demonstrations in Appendix A.1.

Additionally, we normalize demonstration SQL queries by first parsing the SQL queries and unifying their format, such as using lowercase for SQL keywords and database schema and unifying the space around punctuation. Figure 4 provides an example of SQL normalization.

## 4 Experiments

Data & Evaluation For our experiments, we utilize the Spider dataset (Yu et al., 2018), a cross-domain benchmark for the text-to-SQL task. We conduct our experiments on the development set of Spider (Spider-dev) as the test set is not publicly available. Spider-dev consists of 20 databases with 1034 pairs of NLQ and SQL in total. We evaluate models with execution accuracy (EX) which compares the execution results of a predicted SQL and a gold SQL.

In the cross-domain setting, we use the training set of Spider to select demonstration examples. As a few databases contain long schema that may cause the prompt to exceed the token limits of LLMs, we only use the databases with fewer than 1000 tokens when constructing the CreateTable prompt. This results in a total of 130 databases being used as demonstration databases in the cross-domain setting.

## 5 Results

In this section, we present our empirical findings in the areas of zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain text-to-SQL. Through our experiments, we aim to answer a few crucial research questions in each setting and provide insightful strategies for future studies on effective prompting.

### 5.1 Zero-shot Text-to-SQL

In the zero-shot setting, we focus on comparing different prompt constructions for databases. Table

²We employ the Code-davinci-002 version of Codex across all settings. In zero-shot and single-domain setups, we utilize the gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 version of ChatGPT. For cross-domain experiments involving ChatGPT-16K, we turned to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 due to its extended context length.

U|N represents the results of unnormalized prompts and normalized prompts, respectively. The underlines highlight the lower number of tokens and higher accuracies when comparing unnormalized and normalized prompts and the highest accuracy achieved among all prompts is highlighted in bold.

1 shows the average prompt length and execution accuracy of Codex and ChatGPT using various database prompt constructions.

Q1: How does normalized database prompt perform compared to unnormalized ones? Normalized schemas are found to have a reduced token count in comparison to unnormalized schemas across all database constructions. The normalization also tends to yield slightly better performance. As for Codex, normalized schemas show improvement in all prompts. For ChatGPT, normalized schemas either improve accuracy or achieve the same accuracy or achieve the same level of accuracy as unnormalized schemas in 6 out of 7 schema constructions. The tests of statistical significance are presented in Appendix A.2.

Q2: What database knowledge is crucial for effectively prompting LLMs? Our experiments indicate that table relationships and content are important. The Columns=[] prompt includes only the table schema, while the Columns=[]+ForeignKey prompt contains the additional relationship among tables shown as foreign keys. Including such information improves the performance of both Codex (71.8 -> 73.1) and ChatGPT (69.1 -> 71.2). Moveover, exposing LLMs to database content with the SelectRow and SelectCol prompts further enhances the performance of both Codex and ChatGPT, while the InsertRow prompt does not seem to be beneficial. We believe that database content is valuable, but its representation needs to be carefully chosen.

Q3: How does Codex perform compared to ChatGPT? While we do not focus on comparing different LLMs on the text-to-SQL tasks in this paper, it is worth noting that Codex consistently outperforms ChatGPT on zero-shot text-to-SQL using various prompt constructions.

Based on all the findings above, we would recommend using Codex in conjunction with normalized CreateTableSelectCol prompt construction for zero-shot text-to-SQL.³

5.2 Single-domain Text-to-SQL

In the zero-shot text-to-SQL setting, we discovered that the prompt constructions of databases impact the performance of LLMs. This discovery naturally raises the question of whether the introduction of in-domain demonstrations affects the performance of LLMs to different database prompts.

Q1: Does the use of in-domain demonstrations enhance LLM's performance? Figure 5 depicts the performance of Codex and ChatGPT using different database prompt constructions with respect to different numbers of in-domain demonstration examples. For all database prompts, the performance of LLMs experiences a notable improvement when in-domain examples are presented. Furthermore, the performance continues to enhance as the number of in-domain examples increases.

Q2: What database knowledge is important when presenting in-domain demonstrations? While we have observed that the presence of table

Figure 5 shows the execution accuracy of Codex and ChatGPT for single-domain text-to-SQL with 1, 4, 8, and 16 in-domain examples. The graphs display various table-related prompts and their performance across different numbers of shots (in-domain examples).

(a) Codex

| Prompt                 | Description                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Table(Columns)         | Basic table structure                |
| Columns=\[]            | Empty columns                        |
| Table+RS               | Table with relationship structure    |
| Columns=\[]+ForeignKey | Columns with foreign key             |
| CreateTable            | Table creation prompt                |
| Table+RS+Cont          | Table with relationship and content  |
| CreateTable+InsertRow  | Table creation with row insertion    |
| CreateTable+SelectRow  | Table creation with row selection    |
| CreateTable+SelectCol  | Table creation with column selection |


(b) ChatGPT

The graph for ChatGPT shows similar prompts and trends as the Codex graph.

The results indicate that CreateTable+SelectCol outperforms CreateTable by 2.0% for Codex and 1.7% for ChatGPT in the zero-shot scenario. As the number of in-domain examples increases, the performance gap between these two prompts does not significantly reduce. Even with 16 in-domain examples, the gap persists at 1.3 for Codex and 1.9 for ChatGPT.

These findings suggest that LLMs can quickly learn table relationships from a small number of in-domain demonstrations. However, obtaining table content knowledge from demonstration examples remains challenging. Consequently, including table content is crucial for achieving satisfactory performance in the single-domain text-to-SQL scenario.

Q3: Can in-domain demonstrations alleviate the sensitivity of LLMs to the representation of table content?

In the zero-shot setting, LLMs are sensitive to how table content is presented. Specifically, SelectCol 3 outperforms InsertRow 3 by a substantial margin of 3.8 for Codex and 1.8 for ChatGPT. However, as LLMs are exposed to in-domain demonstrations, they become less sensitive to the specific representation of table content. The performance disparities among the three table content prompts become marginal. Notably, with only 4 examples, the performance difference between SelectCol 3 and InsertRow 3 diminishes to 0.3 for Codex and 0.2 for ChatGPT.

To summarize, in single-domain text-to-SQL, it is recommended to incorporate a greater number of in-domain examples when feasible. It is also essential to ensure the presence of table content in conjunction with the table schema, while the specific choice of table content construction is less crucial compared to the zero-shot scenario.

For table relationships, two database prompt constructions are compared: Columns=[] and Columns=[]+ForeignKey. In the zero-shot scenario, Columns=[]+ForeignKey outperforms Columns=[] by 1.3 and 2.1 for Codex and ChatGPT, respectively. However, as the number of in-domain examples increases, the performance gap between these two prompts gradually reduces. With 16 in-domain examples, the gap completely disappears for Codex, while ChatGPT exhibits a marginal difference of only 0.5%.

For table content, CreateTable is compared with CreateTable+SelectCol. Both contain the same prompts for presenting the table schema and relationship, while the latter additionally includes table content. In the zero-shot scenario, CreateTable+SelectCol outperforms CreateTable.

### 5.3 Cross-domain Text-to-SQL

This section presents results answering questions about demonstration and database prompt construction.

#### 5.3.1 Impact of Demonstration Prompt

To investigate the impact of the number of databases and examples per database in demonstrations, experiments are conducted with various combinations. The demonstrations are composed of M demonstration databases, each containing K NLQ-SQL pairs. Scenarios with up to 8 databases and 16 examples per database are considered, as long as the combination does not exceed certain limits (not specified in the given text).

or 16 examples per database leads to a significant decrease in the Codex's performance compared to using 2 or 4 examples per database. Secondly, for a fixed number of examples per database, we observe an initial increase in Codex's performance as the number of databases increases, however, this improvement is followed by a significant decrease once the number of databases reaches a certain threshold (either 4 or 6).

Q2: Why does increasing the number of databases decrease LLMs' performance? As depicted in Figure 2, presenting more databases does not always lead to improved performance. In fact, there is a significant decline in performance, once it surpasses a threshold. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is attributed to the length of the prompt text. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the results in relation to the prompt length.

Figure 7 shows the relationship between the accuracy of different demonstration prompts and their prompt lengths. Notably, the performance of Codex exhibits an inverted-U shape as the prompt length increases for each number of examples per database. Additionally, we observe a substantial drop in performance once the prompt text length exceeds approximately 5500 tokens. Similarly, Figure 9 shows that the performance of ChatGPT-16K starts to decrease when prompt text length exceeds 11K tokens. Based on these observations, we conjecture that LLMs may have a sweet spot in terms of prompt length, potentially influenced by factors such as their model architecture or training data. This indicates that even though LLMs are capable of handling long contexts, they may not necessarily perform better with excessively long prompts.

Each dot on the graph represents a specific demonstration prompt construction, with the m, k denoting the number of databases and examples per database used in the prompt. The lines represent second-degree polynomial trendlines fitted to the results.

exceed the prompt length limit. We opt to use the database prompt CreateTable+SelectRow 3 as it contains fewer tokens compared to InsertRow and SelectCol while encompassing all valuable database knowledge. We present the experiments with Codex in this section. Experiments involving ChatGPT-16K can be found in Appendix A.4 which show similar results as Codex.

Q1: Does increasing demonstration examples enhance LLMs' performance? Figure 2 presents the accuracy of Codex corresponding to different combinations of the number of databases and the number of examples per database used as demonstrations. We analyze the results from two perspectives. Firstly, for a fixed number of databases, we observe an initial improvement in Codex's performance as the number of examples per database increases. However, this improvement plateaus or declines once 4 examples per database are provided. Surprisingly, when using 4 databases, employing 8 or 16 examples per database leads to a significant decrease in the Codex's performance compared to using 2 or 4 examples per database. Secondly, for a fixed number of examples per database, we observe an initial increase in Codex's performance as the number of databases increases, however, this improvement is followed by a significant decrease once the number of databases reaches a certain threshold (either 4 or 6).

5.3.2 Impact of Database Prompt

Since incorporating demonstration databases may cause a decrease in Codex's performance, we focus our database prompt experiments on using one demonstration database in combination with varying quantities of demonstration examples. Table 2 presents the execution accuracy of Codex using different database prompts.

Q3: Do different database prompts show similar trends with the number of demonstration examples? We observe an initial performance increase for all database prompts. However, once more than 4 examples are provided, the improvement starts to level off, indicating that the different database prompts exhibit similar trends in relation to the number of demonstration examples.

Table 2: Cross-domain results of Codex using different database prompt constructions. Only one demonstration database is included in a prompt, N-shot represents N examples corresponding to the demonstration database. The best and second-best results for each shot are highlighted in bold and underlined.

Q4: Can out-of-domain demonstrations alleviate the sensitivity of LLMs to database prompts? First, we observe that incorporating table relationships and content in the prompts remains crucial for effectively prompting Codex in the cross-domain setting. This is not surprising, as Codex cannot directly learn knowledge specific to the test database from the out-of-domain demonstrations. Furthermore, we find that Codex continues to exhibit sensitivity to the representation of table content. Despite having demonstration databases that mirror the construction of the test database, Codex still displays a preference for SelectRow and SelectCol when presenting table content, compared to InsertCol.

In conclusion, while out-of-domain demonstrations enhance LLMs' capabilities in text-to-SQL, they do not provide database-specific knowledge. Consequently, careful construction of database prompts remains crucial, aligning with the observations made in the zero-shot setting.

conducting a comprehensive evaluation of prompt representations across different text-to-SQL settings. While there are similar motivations to the work by Rajkumar et al. (2022), which analyzes the performance of CodeX on Spider for the zero-shot setting and on two databases for the single-domain setting, we aim to provide more general findings by evaluating across a wider range of databases and considering all three text-to-SQL settings.

Table Representation Encoding structured databases with neural models has been a persistent challenge. To encode database schema, graph neural networks are utilized to represent the relationships among tables (Bogin et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021b). Alternatively, other studies (Guo et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2020) have converted table schemas into a sequence to effectively leverage pretrained language models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). In such cases, table relationships can be encoded as meta-data features (Lin et al., 2020) or used as a guide for attention mechanism (Wang et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b).

## 6 Related Work

LLMs for Text-to-SQL In recent years, there has been significant progress in leveraging LLMs for the text-to-SQL task. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. For example, Rubin et al. (2021); Poesia et al. (2022) have demonstrated the effectiveness of similarity-based demonstration retrieval in the cross-domain setting. Additionally, Levy et al. (2022) have highlighted the advantages of incorporating diverse demonstrations for compositional generalization. Furthermore, Pourreza and Rafiei (2023) and Chen et al. (2023) incorporate intermediate steps in prompts and unlock LLMs' capability of self-correcting their predictions.

In contrast to these approaches, our focus lies in To incorporate table content into neural models, prior supervised methods provide question-specific table content by identifying the relevant table content mentioned in the question through string matching (Lin et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2020). However, Chang et al. (2023) have revealed the vulnerability of string matching to perturbations. Given that LLMs with in-context learning support longer input sequences compared to supervised methods, we follow previous work to provide table content without explicitly considering the questions (Rajkumar et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023).

# 7 Conclusions

In this paper, we investigate effective prompting strategies in the text-to-SQL task. We thoroughly compare various prompt construction strategies for databases and demonstrations in the zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain text-to-SQL. Through our investigation, we uncover the critical database knowledge and optimal representations for effective prompting. Additionally, an interesting finding is the existence of a sweet spot in terms of prompt length for Codex in the cross-domain setting. Overall, we believe that our findings will provide valuable guidance for future research in the field of text-to-SQL with LLMs.

## Limitation

We conducted our experiments using 20 databases from the Spider dataset, with the goal of providing general findings for text-to-SQL prompt constructions. However, our findings may not always be applicable to a specific database, particularly if the database is significantly different from the Spider databases. For the single-domain and cross-domain text-to-SQL scenarios, we conduct our experiments multiple times, each involving randomly selecting demonstrations with different random seeds, however, we did not investigate the effectiveness of prompt constructions with different demonstration-retrieval strategies or intermediate reasoning steps.

## Ethics Statement

We acknowledge the importance of the ACL Ethics Policy and agree with it. In this paper, we use OpenAI Codex and ChatGPT as our language models. Codex is currently free for research purposes, the cost of ChatGPT is around $200. The code for the paper is included in the supplementary materials and will be publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

## A.2 Tests of Significance

Table 1 contains the performance of Codex and ChatGPT using different database prompt constructions in the zero-shot setting. We observe that the normalization results in slightly improved performance for all database prompt constructions with Codex and 6 out of 7 database prompt constructions with ChatGPT. It is important to note, however, that when comparing normalized and unnormalized database prompt constructions using the same method, the results did not demonstrate statistical significance in McNemar's test, with p-values greater than 0.05. Nevertheless, the primary advantage of normalization lies in its ability to reduce variations among different databases and minimize the overall prompt length.

When evaluating various prompt constructions, we note the advantages gained from incorporating both table relationships (Columns=[]+ForeignKey vs Columns=[]) and table content (CreateTable+SelectCol 3 vs CreateTable) are mostly statistically significant in McNemar's test, with p-values smaller than 0.05. Table 3 displays the results of the significant tests. The performance of Columns=[]+ForeignKey compared to Columns=[] is statistically significant in all cases, except for codex with normalized prompts. Likewise, the performance of CreateTable+SelectCol 3 is statistically significant for both Codex and ChatGPT, with both normalized and unnormalized prompts, when compared to CreateTable. These significant findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating table relationships and database content.

## A.3 Detailed Single-domain Results

Tables 4 and 5 provide detailed results of Codex and ChatGPT in the single-domain setting, respectively. The performance of both models is also illustrated in Figure 5.

## A.4 Impact of Demonstration Prompt for ChatGPT-16K

Figure 8 presents the accuracy of ChatGPT-16K corresponding to different combinations of the number of databases and the number of examples per database used as demonstrations. Similar to our findings with Codex, presenting more databases does not always lead to improved performance for ChatGPT-16K. For a fixed number of examples per database, we observe an initial increase in its performance as the number of databases increases, however, this improvement is followed by a decrease once the number of databases reaches a certain threshold. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the results in relation to the prompt length.

Figure 9 shows the relationship between the accuracy of different demonstration prompts and their prompt lengths. Similar to Codex, the performance of ChatGPT-16K also exhibits an inverted-U shape as the prompt length increases for each number of examples per database. Additionally, we observe the performance starts to decrease once the prompt text length exceeds approximately 11K tokens.

While Codex supports 8K tokens and ChatGPT-16K supports 16K tokens, we notice that their performance tends to decline when dealing with demonstrations that exceed approximately 70% of the maximum prompt length.
